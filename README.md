# AMS-Reg-Breakout
Breakout PCB for AMS1117 LDO Voltage Regulator

    • AMS1117 LDO Regulator: At the heart of our breakout board lies the AMS1117, a trusted and proven Low Dropout Voltage Regulator. 
    It provides a seamless transition from higher input voltages to a stable and precise output voltage, ensuring your circuits receive the power they need with minimal fluctuations.
    • Wide Voltage Range: Input voltage from 3.6 V to 18 V, Max Ouptut 12V with 1A max current draw.
    • Efficient and Reliable Design: Our breakout board is designed with efficiency and safety in mind, with a 1.2A fuse protecting your circuit elements from over current events, 
    and a heat sink to maximising heat dissipation which not only keeps your components safe from thermal spikes but also extends their operational lifespan.
    • Compact and Practical: We understand the value of space in your projects. Our breakout board features a compact design, making it a convenient choice for various applications where size matters.
    • Easy Integration: Don't waste time deciphering complicated setups. Our breakout board offers user-friendly connectivity with clearly labelled input and output pins. 
    You'll have your voltage regulation up and running quickly.
    • Enhanced Stability: The AMS1117 on our breakout board is known for its remarkable stability. It effectively filters out noise and provides a clean, 
    consistent voltage output – up to 120Hz input frequencies. Perfect for sensitive electronic circuits.
